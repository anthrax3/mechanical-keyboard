A carpenter cares about the quality of his tools. As a programmer (a person that builds digital stuff), I think it is important to care about the tools I use daily. And the keyboard is the main interface for all the work I do, and I spend a lot of time typing on it. Therefor I wanted to create what I think is the perfect tool for the work I do.

In this repo you will find information and resources related to my build, so you can use them for inspiration or whatever you feel like.

## About

* The keyboard is a **60%** mechanical keyboad, with **Satan GH60 PCB** and **Cherry MX Blue switches**.
